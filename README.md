# Smartycle
the project's idea is to motivate people to recycle more using financial benefits.

after recycling and connecting to the app, the user scans the barcode that on the can,
after that the AI system checks if the trash is made of the same type that needed, if it does,
the arduino measures the trash's weight, and sends back the points to the user.

made in GPThon 2023 26-27/2, Israel, in 24 hours only.
